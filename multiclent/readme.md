# Archipelago Multi-Client Toolkit

A multipurpose tool built as a fork of the [Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago), designed to streamline multiworld solo play, toolchain integration, and apworld management.

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 **YAML Builder**: Generate multi-game solo YAMLs with custom settings
- 🚀 **Multiworld Launcher**: Launch all games, sign into the universal tracker, and open Poptracker
- 🔄 **apworld Updater**: Manage apworld versions directly from GitHub releases
